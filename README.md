# A Versatile Hypergraph Model for Document Collections
### EDBT 2020 Submission by Andreas Spitz (1), Dennis Aumiller (2), BÃ¡lint Soproni (2) and Michael Gertz (2)

This repository contains the main code, including all relevant results to reproduce the figures found in the submission. We additionally provide some more detailed analysis of our underlying dataset.


### Reproducing Figures from the Paper
Figures 4 and 5, including all relevant evaluation data, can be found in the folder `EDBT_figures`; subfolders `document_vs_storage` and `window_size_vs_storage` are for Figure 4, and contain JSON files with the respective sizes.<br/>
To see which entities were evaluated specifically, see the `entities.json` in the `runtime_eval` subfolder.

### Data Definition
For Postgres, we list the various schemata in `Schema.md`, also see the definition in `docker/base11/createDBSchema.sql`, as well as `GenerateNewSchema.py` and `GenerateDyadicSQL.py`. <br/>
For Neo4j, see the `Neoj4` subfolder, which contains definitions for the respective models. Note that in Neo4j we need to create a temporary copy of the SQL tables due to the lack of composite primary keys in Neo4j.

### Query implementations
A detailed comparison between the PostgreSQL and Neo4j queries can be found in `Queries.md`.

### Dataset Analysis
To see a more descriptive analysis of the dataset used in the Evaluation section, see `old_eval/dataset_plots/`. In the `old_eval` folder, we also ship some more runtime analysis results on representative samples (entities "Donald Trump" (most frequently occurring entity), "Boris Johnson" (highly frequent), and "2016-07-09" (moderate occurrence frequency)) for various query tasks, performed only on our PostgreSQL implementation.

### Installation Instructions
For now, a complete reproduction of the results is out of scope, as the original dataset is hosted internally, and will generate a blob of over 800 GB in size for the complete evaluation data. For specific installation instructions and reasonable requests about the dataset, please reach out to Dennis Aumiller (`lastname (at) informatik.uni-heidelberg (dot) de`).

The implementation was performed under PostgreSQL 11.4, and Neo4j 3.5.11.
